# PHP_School
This project, like the others, is for educational purposes. This program, given a file, had to filter by name, surname, class, subject and give the average of the student searched for with the possibility of adding a grade to the archive.

IMPORTANT: like the ohter projects id you want to running my code, you have to put the inter folder into htdcos

Screenshoot of my program:
